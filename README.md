# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Using 4 ML classification models for better detection of Breast Cancer


->	Preprocessing the csv data and visualizing the data with seaborn and matplotlib 
    and training them with 4 machine learning classification models (logistic, decision trees, random forests, SVM)
    then the final model is selected based on accuracy score for prediction of breast cancer
    

-> 	Tech stack ïƒ  Python, Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, seaborn
